molotov
=======

Simple Python 3.7+ tool to write load tests.

Based on `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_,
`aiohttp.client <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html>`_.


Quickstart
==========

To create a load test, you need to create a Python module with some functions
decorated with the **scenario** decorator -- those functions needs to be
coroutines. When executed, the function receives a **session** object
inherited from **aiohttp.ClientSession**.

Here's a full example :

.. literalinclude:: ../../molotov/tests/example2.py


When molotov runs, it creates some workers (coroutines) that will
run the functions indefinitely until the test is over. A test is over
when the time in seconds provided by **--duration** option is reached or
when the maximum number of runs defined by **--max-runs** is reached.

By default, molotov will run for 86400 seconds (one day), but
you can stop it any time with Ctrl-C.

Each worker randomly picks one scenario to execute, given their weights.
Once it's finished, it picks the next one, and so on. In our example,
**scenario_two** is picked ~60% of the time.


.. note::

   Check out aiohttp's documentation to understand how to work with
   a session object.

To run the load script, you can provide its module name or its path.
In the example below, the script is executed in quiet mode with
10 processes and 200 workers for 60 seconds. It stops on the first failure:


.. code-block:: bash

    $ molotov molotov/tests/example.py -p 10 -w 200 -d 60 -qx
